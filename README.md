# Daniel Rosehill's GitHub

---

I'm Daniel Rosehill, based in Jerusalem, Israel. I work in tech communications with a focus on AI systems, workflow automation, and agent orchestration.

This GitHub profile serves as a record of my experiments and projects in AI, particularly around RAG pipelines, context development, and multi-agent systems. The complete structure is organized in my [Master Index](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index).

## AI Focus

My primary interest lies in developing personal context data to enhance RAG pipelines for hyper-personalized inference. I'm exploring how contextual information can be systematically captured and used to improve AI interactions.

Key areas:
- Context-aware AI applications
- RAG pipeline development
- Multi-agent systems and workflow orchestration
- Prompt engineering and system design
